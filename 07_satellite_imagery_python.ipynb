    "GDAL is a powerful and mature library for reading, writing and warping raster datasets, written in C++ with bindings to other languages. There are a variety of geospatial libraries available on the python package index, and almost all of them depend on GDAL. One such python library developed and supported by Mapbox, rasterio, builds on top of GDAL’s many features, but provides a more pythonic interface and supports many of the features and formats that GDAL supports. Both GDAL and rasterio are constantly being updated and improved: As of writing this tutorial (July 2020), GDAL is at version 3.1.1 and rasterio is at version 1.1.5.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Landsat program is the longest-running civilian satellite imagery program, with the first satellite launched in 1972 by the US Geological Survey. Landsat 8 is the latest satellite in this program, and was launched in 2013. Landsat observations are processed into “scenes”, each of which is approximately 183 km x 170 km, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and a temporal resolution of 16 days. The duration of the landsat program makes it an attractive source of medium-scale imagery for land surface change analyses. Landsat is multiband imagery, you can read more about it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason we’ll use Landsat 8 for this lesson is that the entire Landsat 8 archive is hosted by various commercial Cloud providers with free public access (AWS and Google Cloud)!\n",

    "A single Landsat8 scene is about 1 Gb in size since it contains a large array of data for each imagery band. Images are often grouped into a single .tar.gz file, which requires scientists to download the entire 1 Gb, even if you are just interested in a single band or subset of the image. To circumvent downloading, a new format has been proposed for Cloud storage called Cloud-optimized Geotiffs (COGs), to allow easy access to individual bands or even subsets of single images.\n",

This context manager, rasterio.open() functions like the python standard library function open for opening files. The block of code within the with … as statement is executed once the file is opened, and the file is closed when the context manager exits. This means that we don’t have to manually close the raster file, as the context manager handles that for us.\n",

We see that it is a Geotiff (Gtiff), the image values are unsigned integer format, nodata values are not assigned, the image has a dimensions of 7711x7531, is a single band, is in UTM coordinates, has a simple affine transformation, is chunked into smaller 512x512 arrays, tiled and compressed on the AWS hard drive where it is stored.\n",

It also turns out that AWS stores pre-made image overviews, but Google does not. It is important to realize that not all archives are the same! In fact the Google Cloud storage archive is a complete mirror of the full USGS archive, whereas as of writing this, AWS only has collection 1 scenes after 2017. In general, performance will be best if you are accessing data locally (so if you are running this notebook on AWS, use the landsat public data on AWS)! We are going to use the AWS archive for the rest of this lesson because of the convenience of overviews:"

Images commonly look like this because of satellite orbits and the fact that the Earth is rotating as imagery is acquired! The colormap is often improved if we change the out of bounds area to NaN. To do this we have to convert the datatype from uint16 to float32 (so be aware the array with NaNs will take 2x the storage space). The serrated edge is due to the coarse sampling of the full resolution image that we are doing here."

The array values do no need to be duplicated, the VRT file just contains a reference to the local file (LC08_L1TP_042034_20170616_20170629_01_T1_NDVI_OVIEW.tif).
